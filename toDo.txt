To Do:

1- Make vehicle with animations.
2- Make two generic buildings made up of walls and misc to copy and paste.
3- Make checkpoints.
4- Make map containing checkpoints.
5- Make a loading screen full of levels, and make an icon for level 1.


6- Make general rendering and loading skeleton:
  Make a list of objects, each with its own coordinates.
  modelname     coordinate

7- Make a directory, models, to hold all of the nonmap obj files to load.
8- Make a directory, maps, to hold all the map obj files.





What should happen when initiated:
loadListObj(levelsMenu); //Pushes the title, and load level selection.
loadListObj(level1) runs if text 'level 1' from above render is clicked.
  //loadListObj(listName) will load the map and all of the objects in the list.
Loop(); //Checks whether in a checkpoint object, checks the actions pending in queue.
Car is spawned on top of a checkpoint. Checkpoint initiates a text box action and eagleview camera 
  pans through track.

string map = "";
vector<void(*)()> actionQueue;
initWindow(int width, int height);
loadListObj(levelsMenu);
loadListObj(level1);
Loop() {
  updateOrientAndPos(); //Take keyboard and mouse input to rotate camera and position
  inCheckPoint(); //Check if in checkpoint
  runActionQueue(); //pops and pushes function pointers, iterating through actionQueue
}
